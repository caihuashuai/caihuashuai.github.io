- the modern economic landscape is increasingly dominated by a few major companies built around some large private markets
	- e.g. :
		- Amazon / Alibaba for e-commerce
		- Apple / Google for apps
		- Uber / Lyft / DiDi for transportation
		- Google / Facebook / Microsoft / Amazon for ads
	- as a result, there's been some interest (from e.g. these institutions) on characterizing the equilibrium behavior of large markets
- some relevant strands of work:
	1. probably the crowning achievement of classical economic theory was providing formal foundations for market equilibrium
		- this classical work seems to have least partially been motivated by a desire to provide some sort of 'scientific' justification for capitalism (this was the 50s, after all) 
		- thus, focus on abstract markets, intuitively corresponding to national-level economies
		- focused on characterizing existence / uniqueness / welfare properites of equilibria 
		- based on fixed-point arguments, so not that useful for actually finding equilibria
	2. starting in the early 2000s, algorithmic game theorists have begun devising algorithms for / characterizing the complexity of computing these equilibria.
		- for some reasonable models of markets, complexity is polynomial (and sometimes even quite fast
		- but given the scale of the markets of interest described above, even writing down the entire market is a challenge
	3. there's also been some recent-ish work in math / stats on characterizing the limit behavior of graphs
- I'll discuss how results from these three areas can be used to approach the problem of characterizing equilibrium behavior in large markets
